Hindi: दो घड़े और एक घड़ी कितने साथ मिलेंगे?

Translation: How will two horses and a chair come together?

Hindi: घड़ी घड़ी घड़ी बैठ जाएंगी (Ghari ghari ghari baith jaeenge)

Translation: The horses will sit on each other. (Literally: Chairs will sit on chairs)

Because it has too many bugs!

This joke is a nod to the fact that programmers spend a lot of their time debugging, or removing errors, from their code. Nature, on the other hand, is full of insects and other creatures that can be considered bugs. So, the humor lies in the comparison between the two.",3220,6,87,93,true,
